# Creating an NFT collection in the TON main network

If you are an NFT-collection author for TON but don't have good technical skills, you better wait until when NFT-marketplaces (like https://getgems.io) make their UI for creating collections.
The marketplaces are currently working on this functionality, creating a collection via the marketplace website will be as easy as posting a photo to social networks.

More advanced users can deploy now.
